How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure, I utilize testing techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, & user acceptance. Automation testing tools can also aide in streamlining the time it takes to test something. I also make sure that I adhere to secure coding practices. For example, I make sure to validate input in order to mitigate SQL Injetion attacks.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Understanding user needs involes engaging directly with the usr. I intend to use interviews, surverys, and usability studies. 

How do I approach designing software?

When I approach designing software I want to make sure I have clear goals or objectives. Next, I want to create an outline of the system to create a blueprint to go off of. I like to use tried and true design patterns and standard practices for my UMLs. Scalability, usability, & maintainability are at the forefront of my thought process as well.
